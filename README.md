# Echo app IA prototype

> A prototype for the app information architecture project. Read more on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/echohealth/App-Information-Architecture-dfbda084a8cf4db1857f3bdc676f59e5) and check out design progress in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/pSgcINbjEjrxmllLntpS7l/IA-vision?node-id=1%3A2).

## Demo

You can see a version of this running on the public internet at [echo-app-ia.surge.sh](https://echo-app-ia.surge.sh). It might not be the same version as in this repo.

_There's nothing sensitive, but it would be nice if it wasn't shared outside of Echo. Speak to @samkingco about publishing/unpublishing._

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
